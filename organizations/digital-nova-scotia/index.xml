      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seed&lt;/strong&gt; is a documentary that follows an international group of programmer entrepreneurs at Angelhack: one of the most competitive global hackathons and digital business ideation competitions. Three minutes to pitch. One shot to fund their proposals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seed&lt;/strong&gt; is also a gathering of our Annapolis Valley startup community.  The event will feature the diversity of associations, businesses, and individuals who comprise our digital tech startup community.  An assembly of our entrepreneurial family.  Come mingle and build your network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introductory keynote address by &lt;a href=&#34;https://refreshannapolisvalley.org/person/leanne-strathdee&#34;&gt;Leanne Strathdee&lt;/a&gt;
,
Manager of Innovation and Incubation for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://refreshannapolisvalley.org/organization/acadia-entrepreneurship-centre&#34;&gt;
    
        Acadia Entrepreneurship Centre

 &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Directed by Andrew Wonder and produced by Station Film and Something Different, &lt;strong&gt;Seed&lt;/strong&gt; is a documentary feature film which dives head first into the thrilling and daunting world of Silicon Valley. The film tells the story of the new American Dream, where innovators from around the world come to Silicon Valley with the hope of turning their ideas into billion dollar valuations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a riveting behind-the-scenes look at the preparation behind an investor pitch, Seed follows an Uber driver from New York, three local high school kids, and five college students from Nairobi as they compete in a high profile hackathon for the seed money they need to turn their dreams into reality. The rollercoaster ride of sleepless nights and tough-love coaching culminates in a final presentation before a full audience of tech executives and tastemakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Silicon Valley is a world where you only hear about big successes and IPOs, but never about the people who are fighting everyday to make their dreams a reality. I hope Seed can be an anthem for anyone who has gone down this path, successful or not, and show an honest look at what it takes to turn that app idea you had at dinner into a business that works,” Andrew Wonder says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andrew paints a vivid picture of the raw drive and passion that fuels each team. Their backstories come to life as the viewer watches each person experience both the lows from unexpected setbacks and highs when something finally goes right. Andrew captures these tensions, victories, and sacrifices through his organic observational approach; his keen eye draws out the humanity and spirit of each character’s unique story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film focuses on a hackathon competition hosted by AngelHack, a female-owned, female-majority company and the world’s largest and most diverse hacker community. “I’m grateful to AngelHack for the access they gave us and the teams for always being willing to share and let us in. It’s not easy to show how hard the path can be when all you want is for everyone else to see you as a success,” Andrew says of the partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CODE: Debugging the Gender Gap</title>
      <link>https://refreshannapolisvalley.org/event/code-debugging-the-gender-gap/</link>

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CODE: Debugging The Gender Gap&lt;/em&gt; exposes the dearth of female and minority
software engineers and explores the reasons for this gender gap and digital divide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tech jobs are growing three times faster than our colleges are producing computer science
graduates. By 2019 there will be 182,000 jobs in information and communications technology
that will go unfilled by homegrown Canadian talent because not enough people will have the right skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through compelling interviews, artistic animation and clever flashpoints in popular culture,
&lt;em&gt;CODE&lt;/em&gt; examines the reasons why more girls and people of color are not seeking out
opportunities in computer science and explores how cultural mindsets, stereotypes,
educational hurdles, and sexism all play roles in this national crisis. Expert voices from the
worlds of tech, psychology, science, and education are intercut with personal stories of women
who are engaged in the fight to challenge complacency in the tech industry and have their
voices heard. &lt;em&gt;CODE&lt;/em&gt; aims to inspire change in mindsets, in the educational system, in startup
culture and in the way women see themselves in the field of coding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This screening will feature an introductory keynote address by &lt;a href=&#34;https://refreshannapolisvalley.org/person/ulrike-bahr-gedalia&#34;&gt;Ulrike Bahr-Gedalia&lt;/a&gt;
,
President and CEO of &lt;a href=&#34;https://refreshannapolisvalley.org/organization/digital-nova-scotia&#34;&gt;
    
        Digital Nova Scotia
    
&lt;/a&gt;
, to provide Canadian context to the film.
&lt;em&gt;CODE&lt;/em&gt; will also be followed by an interactive panel discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Computer code forms the foundation of modern society. Cell phones, apps, navigation systems,
medical equipment, banking, movie animation… are all driven by code. The more diverse a
team of coders is, the broader their perspective of society’s needs, which can ultimately result
in products that serve a greater breadth of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CODE&lt;/em&gt; takes a hard look at the pipeline question in technology: why aren’t there more women
and minority graduates in computer science? What is stopping them from getting to the
threshold? &lt;em&gt;CODE&lt;/em&gt; follows the various challenges faced by a new generation of women
programmers and the ingenious ways they are using their skills, drive, intellect and vision to
disrupt the traditional, male-dominated tech world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CODE&lt;/em&gt; looks to the past, delving into the history of computing to highlight women like Ada
Lovelace and Grace Hopper who set the stage for today’s technology. &lt;em&gt;CODE&lt;/em&gt; acknowledges that
women have been an important part of computing since the genesis of computers, but have
since been written out of this history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CODE&lt;/em&gt; is not afraid to ask the hard questions and does so with intelligence and a sense of
humor, examining our culture from high (the views of former Harvard President Larry Summers
on innate ability) to low (an app called &amp;ldquo;Titstare&amp;rdquo; presented to a room of tech heavyweights).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A blend of personal stories, expert voices, innovative animation, historic discoveries, and
moments from popular culture are complemented with a cutting edge musical score and
bolstered by a strong sense of purpose. &lt;em&gt;CODE&lt;/em&gt; reflects, at its heart, the interconnectedness of
the stories, the web, and by proxy, the shared vision of a new, more democratic community
made possible by the inclusion of more women in code.&lt;/p&gt;
