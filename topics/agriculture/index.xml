      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://refreshannapolisvalley.org/person/dr-daniel-silver&#34;&gt;Dr Daniel Silver&lt;/a&gt;
 will review a series of projects undertaken by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://refreshannapolisvalley.org/organization/acadia-institute-for-data-analytics&#34;&gt;
    
        Acadia Institute for Data Analytics
    
&lt;/a&gt;
.  These amazing projects can estimate crop yield from smart phone images, do solar energy forecasting, manage building energy, determine stream flow rate and aquifer recharge prediction, sales forecasting, and classifying objects in UAV agriculture field images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these problems utilize high resolution observed and forecasted weather, high definition and multi-spectral digital images, and 5 minute through 60 minute data flow rates.  These projects use a variety of machine learning methods.  Come learn about standard neural networks, random forests, more advanced deep and recurrent neural networks, as well as transfer learning.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Business-hypothesis-driven experimentation.  Iterative product releases. Validated learning.  Pivot. Pivot. Pivot.  Welcome to the tech startup world of &lt;a href=&#34;https://refreshannapolisvalley.org/person/john-frost&#34;&gt;John Frost&lt;/a&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the early days of Frostbyte Interactive, Aerhyve Aerial Technologies, and now PrecisionHawk, John&amp;rsquo;s pursuit of innovative products and services in the digital tech space runs years long.  Join us for a fireside chat with John where we will explore the inner working of a person committed to the startup life.  We will examine his failures, study lessons learned from the startup trenches, and most importantly celebrate his successes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John&amp;rsquo;s story is one also of the Annapolis Valley startup community.  As a tenant of the Rural Innovation Centre at Acadia University from day one, we will also explore how we are fairing in incubating innovative within our community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://refreshannapolisvalley.org/person/emily-konrath&#34;&gt;Emily Konrath&lt;/a&gt;
, Economic Development Officer, with the Valley Regional Enterprise Network will be our tour guide at our meetup.&lt;/p&gt;
