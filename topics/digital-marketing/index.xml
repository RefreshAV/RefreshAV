&lt;p&gt;Our monthly Refresh meetup is where the Annapolis Valley community of designers, developers and innovators come hang out.  Those interested in the creative, technical, and professional culture of digital technology endeavours in the Annapolis Valley meet and talk about all things design, technology, and entrepreneurship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refresh meets the second Tuesday evening of each month in the Wolfville area. These are casual affairs with short, member-interest talks followed by an opportunity to mingle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All are welcome&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join our &lt;strong&gt;mailing list&lt;/strong&gt; (see below) to stay up-to-date about our upcoming meetups.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wes Booth literally grew up during the birth of social media. In 2006, he signed on Facebook for the first time and in 2013 he sent his first Snap. Wes started his first business when he was 14 and is now working on a project to better connect and support brands and creative talent in Nova Scotia through his social media community called We Are NS. Wes believes in Atlantic Canada 100% and is determined social media is a good place to start telling our stories. He thinks the fresh perspective and confidence that youth bring to the table could be our answer!&lt;/p&gt;
