&lt;p&gt;Get Inspired, Get Connected, Get involved. HUB spaces provide an inspirational home to members and are a focal point for change within the local communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-the-hub&#34;&gt;What is the Hub?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HUB is about the power of innovation through collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe there is no shortage of good ideas to solve the issues of our time. But there is an acute lack of collaboration and support structures to help make them happen. The HUB was founded to address this need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set out to create spaces that combine the best of a trusted community, innovation lab, business incubator and the comforts of home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spaces with all the tools and trimmings needed to grow and develop innovative ventures for the world. But above all, spaces for meaningful encounters, exchange and inspiration, full of diverse people doing amazing things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea has been spreading like wildfire and resulted in the emergence of a global movement. To date, there are 25+ open HUBs and many more in the making, from London to San Francisco, Johannesburg, Melbourne and Sao Paulo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;mission&#34;&gt;Mission&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To become a global network of connected communities that enable collaborative ventures for a better world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the HUB, people from every profession, background and culture are being united by one thing: the imagination and drive to pursue enterprising ideas for the world. These are the people who see and do things differently and have entrepreneurial passion to create sustainable impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HUB is becoming the place they call home.&lt;/p&gt;
