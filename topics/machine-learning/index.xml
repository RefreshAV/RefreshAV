      <description>&lt;p&gt;I make stuff happen at Agile*, an independent geoscience idea factory in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We build awesome knowledge engines for organizations (mostly wikis), and we hone our skills in subsurface science&amp;hellip; We have most recently been working on geothermal reservoir description. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked the Montney tight gas of Alberta and BC, frontier exploration in the Canadian Beaufort Sea, the Athabasca oil sands, the Norwegian North Sea. I also worked in software for several years, as an advocate of integrated volume visualization and interpretation and viz room pilot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2001 I&amp;rsquo;ve been a registered professional Geologist and professional Geophysicist in Alberta. I review technical papers for SEG&amp;rsquo;s journal Geophysics. I sometimes teach university courses. With my Agile colleague, I write a blog at agilegeoscience.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specialties: Seismic interpretation and analysis, sedimentology, sequence stratigraphy, geoscience software, integrated reservoir description, knowledge sharing, writing&lt;/p&gt;
