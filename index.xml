      <title>CODE: Debugging the Gender Gap</title>
      <link>https://refreshannapolisvalley.org/event/code-debugging-the-gender-gap/</link>

        &lt;img src=&#34;https://refreshannapolisvalley.org/images/event/code-debugging-the-gender-gap/poster.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;CODE: Debugging the Gender Gap&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CODE: Debugging The Gender Gap&lt;/em&gt; exposes the dearth of female and minority
software engineers and explores the reasons for this gender gap and digital divide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tech jobs are growing three times faster than our colleges are producing computer science
graduates. By 2019 there will be 182,000 jobs in information and communications technology
that will go unfilled by homegrown Canadian talent because not enough people will have the right skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through compelling interviews, artistic animation and clever flashpoints in popular culture,
&lt;em&gt;CODE&lt;/em&gt; examines the reasons why more girls and people of color are not seeking out
opportunities in computer science and explores how cultural mindsets, stereotypes,
educational hurdles, and sexism all play roles in this national crisis. Expert voices from the
worlds of tech, psychology, science, and education are intercut with personal stories of women
who are engaged in the fight to challenge complacency in the tech industry and have their
voices heard. &lt;em&gt;CODE&lt;/em&gt; aims to inspire change in mindsets, in the educational system, in startup
culture and in the way women see themselves in the field of coding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This screening will feature an introductory keynote address by &lt;a href=&#34;https://refreshannapolisvalley.org/person/ulrike-bahr-gedalia&#34;&gt;Ulrike Bahr-Gedalia&lt;/a&gt;
,
President and CEO of &lt;a href=&#34;https://refreshannapolisvalley.org/organization/digital-nova-scotia&#34;&gt;
    
        Digital Nova Scotia
    
&lt;/a&gt;
, to provide Canadian context to the film.
&lt;em&gt;CODE&lt;/em&gt; will also be followed by an interactive panel discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Computer code forms the foundation of modern society. Cell phones, apps, navigation systems,
medical equipment, banking, movie animation… are all driven by code. The more diverse a
team of coders is, the broader their perspective of society’s needs, which can ultimately result
in products that serve a greater breadth of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CODE&lt;/em&gt; takes a hard look at the pipeline question in technology: why aren’t there more women
and minority graduates in computer science? What is stopping them from getting to the
threshold? &lt;em&gt;CODE&lt;/em&gt; follows the various challenges faced by a new generation of women
programmers and the ingenious ways they are using their skills, drive, intellect and vision to
disrupt the traditional, male-dominated tech world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CODE&lt;/em&gt; looks to the past, delving into the history of computing to highlight women like Ada
Lovelace and Grace Hopper who set the stage for today’s technology. &lt;em&gt;CODE&lt;/em&gt; acknowledges that
women have been an important part of computing since the genesis of computers, but have
since been written out of this history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CODE&lt;/em&gt; is not afraid to ask the hard questions and does so with intelligence and a sense of
humor, examining our culture from high (the views of former Harvard President Larry Summers
on innate ability) to low (an app called &amp;ldquo;Titstare&amp;rdquo; presented to a room of tech heavyweights).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A blend of personal stories, expert voices, innovative animation, historic discoveries, and
moments from popular culture are complemented with a cutting edge musical score and
bolstered by a strong sense of purpose. &lt;em&gt;CODE&lt;/em&gt; reflects, at its heart, the interconnectedness of
the stories, the web, and by proxy, the shared vision of a new, more democratic community
made possible by the inclusion of more women in code.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Creative Computing</title>
      <link>https://refreshannapolisvalley.org/project/creative-computing/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Creative Computing is a course developed by an international network of educators passionate about exposing kids to the computer sciences.  Broken up into 7 units, this course uses the popular Scratch programming environment to aid young people in learning the basics software development.  Scratch is used over the world by students to easily create animations and games while acting as a stepping stone to the more advanced world of computer science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;objectives&#34;&gt;Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;img class=&#34;thumbnail&#34; src=&#34;https://refreshannapolisvalley.org/images/project/creative-computing/objectives.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Objectives&#34; align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, we aim to provide opportunities for young learners to become exposed to the computer sciences and inter-related disciplines (other science and technology fields as well as entrepreneurship).  Our goal is to provide a learning environment that goes beyond what students are taught in public schools about the computer sciences.  We will explore software as both a creative and entrepreneurial act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;who-are-we&#34;&gt;Who Are We?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;img class=&#34;thumbnail&#34; src=&#34;https://refreshannapolisvalley.org/images/project/creative-computing/who-are-we.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Mike and Kids&#34; align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Mike Caplan is a web application developer with over 16 years experience working in non-profit, university, retail, agricultural, and dental industries.  Mike also runs Refresh Annapolis Valley, a new media professional association to help grow the Valley’s digital technology industry.  Max (15), Solomon (11) and Mike (really old) have been working with Scratch for over 5 years as a tool to help promote the computer sciences within the Valley with young people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img class=&#34;thumbnail&#34; src=&#34;https://refreshannapolisvalley.org/images/project/creative-computing/hm.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Mrugakshee Palwe and Hayly Anne Thackeray&#34; align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Mrugakshee Palwe and Hayly Anne Thackeray are Co-President of the Acadia Computer Science Society. Both are students at the Acadia University Jodrey School of Computer Science in their third year of the Bachelor of Computer Science program and active members in Women In Science and Engineering Acadia. Mrugakshee and Hayly have run programs working with girls and boys on several topics within the computer sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe that offering an extracurricular course on Scratch for kids 8 to 13 will help this generation develop a fundamental literacy around the computer sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;format&#34;&gt;Format&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;img class=&#34;thumbnail&#34; src=&#34;https://refreshannapolisvalley.org/images/project/creative-computing/format.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Format&#34; align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Creative Computing will run weekly starting January 9th, 2017 following the Wolfville Elementary School academic schedule for Mondays.  Each class will run for 2 hours and 15 minutes, from 6 PM to 8:15 PM.  Snow days will bump the class to the Thursday of the same week (weather permitting).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course will be made up of 19 classes with the final Monday class taking place on June 12th.  A weekend two day &amp;ldquo;Innovation Fest&amp;rdquo; will cap off the course June 24 and 25.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The class will follow a six unit curriculum.  Units are broken down into several exercises that range from 15 to 60 minutes a piece.   The class mentors will share teaching and mentoring responsibilities.  We will aim to have a 5 students to 1 mentor ratio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Innovation Fest event, participants will brainstorm an idea, develop a project, and showcase a final prototype using an iterative plan-make-reflect cycle.  It will provide an excellent opportunity for participants to invent their own relevant projects to work on, which can be developed as independent projects or in collaborative teams, and demonstrate their knowledge in Scratch within a collaborative, creative, flexible, and playful environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;guest-speakers&#34;&gt;Guest Speakers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;img class=&#34;thumbnail&#34; src=&#34;https://refreshannapolisvalley.org/images/project/creative-computing/guests.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Guest Speakers&#34; align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We have designed the class to have upwards to 12 guest speaker slots of 20 minutes to 30 minutes each.  With the guest speakers we aim to illustrate how the classwork can translate to industry application.  We also would like to introduce other topics in and around the computer sciences to give the student a wider sense of the world beyond our Scratch development environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;class-size&#34;&gt;Class Size&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;img class=&#34;thumbnail&#34; src=&#34;https://refreshannapolisvalley.org/images/project/creative-computing/size.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Class Size&#34; align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The course class size will be capped at 20 learners.  The age range of the students sought will be between 8 and 13, but not limited to.  Where historically such classes tend to be predominantly male, we will limit student spots for boys to 50% in order to promote diverse gender participation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;class-location&#34;&gt;Class Location&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;img class=&#34;thumbnail&#34; src=&#34;https://refreshannapolisvalley.org/images/organization/acadia-entrepreneurship-centre/icon.png&#34; alt=&#34;Class Location&#34; align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The class will be hosted by the Acadia Entrepreneurship Centre Rural Innovation Centre at Acadia University.  The Rural Innovation Centre supports entrepreneurs and businesses in the Annapolis Valley and provides an incubator program for start up companies. This location gives us both an opportunity to introduce young learners to the Acadia campus, and alows us to draw from works of entrepreneurship taking place at this specific campus location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;requirements&#34;&gt;Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;img class=&#34;thumbnail&#34; src=&#34;https://refreshannapolisvalley.org/images/project/creative-computing/requirements.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Requirements&#34; align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The total cost for the course is $190 ($10 per class) per student.  We realize that this fee will not scale to meet everyone&amp;rsquo;s budget.  We will provide a number of as needed reduced tuition rates at $114 and as low as $0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students will also need to bring a laptop to each class.  The laptop needs to be able to run a modern web browser such as Google Chrome.  A mouse is also highly recommended.  We will supply course material as well as hardware prototyping boards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t have a laptop available for your child to use, we will work to source one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parents will be asked to provide class snacks on a rotating as needed basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;registration&#34;&gt;Registration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or &lt;a href=&#34;https://goo.gl/forms/9DrKqRJZEh4muw7y1&#34;&gt;open the registration form directly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a 15 year career with various businesses and economic development organizations, Andrew felt it was about time to move from being a ‘cheerleader’ and ‘curator’ of entrepreneurship to doing something that actually produced more entrepreneurs in rural communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​In 2014 he founded &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mashuplab.ca/&#34;&gt;Mashup Lab&lt;/a&gt;; a for-more-than-profit company that activates rural ideas.  That same year he launched a chapter of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.awesomesouthshore.ca/&#34;&gt;Awesome Foundation&lt;/a&gt; in his community. Andrew has since gone on to launch another social enterprise - &lt;a href=&#34;https://refreshannapolisvalley.org/organization/co3&#34;&gt;
    
        CO3
    
&lt;/a&gt;
, a fresh new coworking space for Freelancers, Entrepreneurs, and Independents located in Bridgewater, Nova Scotia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andrew&amp;rsquo;s work with over 1,000 Entrepreneurs located in rural has convinced him that great ideas can come from anywhere. His passion and energy is focused on one thing: unleashing entrepreneurial potential in rural communities that has yet to be inspired into action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Andrew&amp;rsquo;s banner image is a Captain Canuck inspired rendition of artwork blatantly ripped off the Mashup Lab website.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CO3 is a fresh bew co-working space for freelancers, entrepreneurs and independents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CO3 Is a concept created by &lt;a href=&#34;https://refreshannapolisvalley.org/person/andrew-button&#34;&gt;​Andrew Button&lt;/a&gt;
, a social entrepreneur based in Bridgewater, Nova Scotia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The mission is to create a space that further cultivates rural Nova Scotia&amp;rsquo;s freelance economy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the success of his own company Mashup Lab and other social ventures ​he&amp;rsquo;s discovered a lot of hidden talent in the Maritimes which he feels needs more room to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Just like becoming an expert in wine - you learn by drinking it, the best you can afford - you learn great food by finding the best there is, whether simply or luxurious. Then you savor it, analyze it, discuss it with your companions, and you compare it with other experiences&amp;rdquo; - Julia Child, &lt;em&gt;Mastering the Art of French Cooking&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
