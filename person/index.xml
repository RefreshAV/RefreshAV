      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a 15 year career with various businesses and economic development organizations, Andrew felt it was about time to move from being a ‘cheerleader’ and ‘curator’ of entrepreneurship to doing something that actually produced more entrepreneurs in rural communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​In 2014 he founded &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mashuplab.ca/&#34;&gt;Mashup Lab&lt;/a&gt;; a for-more-than-profit company that activates rural ideas.  That same year he launched a chapter of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.awesomesouthshore.ca/&#34;&gt;Awesome Foundation&lt;/a&gt; in his community. Andrew has since gone on to launch another social enterprise - &lt;a href=&#34;https://refreshannapolisvalley.org/organization/co3&#34;&gt;
    
        CO3
    
&lt;/a&gt;
, a fresh new coworking space for Freelancers, Entrepreneurs, and Independents located in Bridgewater, Nova Scotia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andrew&amp;rsquo;s work with over 1,000 Entrepreneurs located in rural has convinced him that great ideas can come from anywhere. His passion and energy is focused on one thing: unleashing entrepreneurial potential in rural communities that has yet to be inspired into action.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“Creative Technician”&amp;hellip;what the heck is that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see my role, primarily, as that of a possibilitist. I listen closely to your ideas, what you hope to create, the problem you are working and then share with you the possibilities technology may offer. My years of immersion in Maker culture, joyfully exploring new and unusual uses for the wonders of emerging and age-old tech, provide me with a deep pool of possible solutions to your creative problems. While I am happy to help suggest solutions and inform you of the possibilities and challenges, I always keep in mind that the piece is YOUR work and will strive to help YOUR vision come to fruition. In those cases where a more collaborative model is what you are seeking, I would love to work with you to make our ideas a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
