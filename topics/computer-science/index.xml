&lt;p&gt;Engaging both members and stakeholders in the region, Digital Nova Scotia provides advocacy, multi-sectoral industry intelligence, facilitates connections between industry and talent, and delivers high-level programming to ensure Nova Scotia’s $1.5 billion digital industry (which boasts an additional $1 billion in spin-offs) continues to flourish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;it-starts-here-it-stays-here-it-grows-here&#34;&gt;IT starts here. IT stays here. IT grows here.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the industry association for the fastest growing sector in the province with the highest number of ICT graduates per capita in Canada, Digital Nova Scotia encourages our tech talent and growing ecosystem of digital businesses to start here, stay here, and grow here! We believe that Nova Scotia’s digital technologies sector has the potential to be what the oil and gas sector is for Alberta. Nova Scotia has the “IT” factor: globally competitive talent, an ecosystem of support, advanced digital infrastructure, and a drive to push our economic boundaries. We are going for growth on a global scale!&lt;/p&gt;
